# Car Price Analysis
## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between various features of cars and their prices. Using a dataset of car features and corresponding prices, we analyze how different factors, such as engine location, body style, and drive wheels, correlate with the price of a car. We also visualize these relationships through scatter plots and box plots to better understand key factors that influence car pricing.

## 1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values 
Removed duplicate entries.
Converted categorical features to numerical values.
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Examined the distribution of car prices and other key variables.
Generated summary statistics to understand basic characteristics of each variable (mean, median, min, max, etc.).
## 3. Correlation Analysis
Calculated correlation coefficients to examine the relationship between each feature and the target variable (Price).
Key observations:
Strong positive/negative correlations between body style and price.
Weak or negligible correlations between peak-rpm and price.
## 4. Data Visualization
#### Scatter Plots:
Plotted key continuous variables (e.g., Year, Mileage, Engine Size) against Price to visualize trends.
Identified potential outliers and clusters.
Box Plots:
Created box plots to understand the distribution of prices across categorical variables .
These visualizations helped identify price ranges for different groups.
Findings
Feature Correlations:
The analysis revealed that certain variables have a significant impact on car price. For example:
Convertible Cars tend to have higher prices.
Cars with drive wheels of type RWD generally cost more.

Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into which factors most significantly impact car prices. These findings can help potential car buyers and sellers make informed decisions based on the key drivers of car value. The visualizations also highlight trends and relationships that may not be obvious from summary statistics alone.
